# Notice

The icons included here are embedded as resources in the DLL and are used only in the 
`ROOT.IntuitiveInteraction.IntuitiveMessageBox` class.

The icons were extracted from the Windows 8 shell32.dll file located at the Windows System32 directory.

Additionally , there is now included the `codepages.nlp` file in the assembly , which is the native Code Page Mapper
used in the System.Text.Encoding.CodePages package , due to the package demands.
