# Project MDCFR: Application Development Framework
The directory structure was radically changed so as to not render large previews
when using the GitHub Preview.

This allows a gathered and simple view of the MDCFR directory structure , 
while the directories nicely contain the projects and the tools too.

This directory contains the MDCFR Project along with the HTTPLIB deprecation
assembly that only targets .NET 7.0  (Since .NET 7.0 does have deprecated the used API) .

You might have noticed out that here a .snk file is existing.

This file is the Project's Strong Name key and it is the unique identifier of MDCFR.
