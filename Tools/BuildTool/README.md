### Notice

Due to the limitations that the `CMD` language provides , the whole codebase was rewritten to .NET.

This gives the opportunity for extensible builds , plus adds more commands to use.

The `MDCFR-Builder.exe` is a Windows .NET executable file , and it is protected by dissasembly tools.

Every new version of the tool will be redistributed here for the needs of this repository.
