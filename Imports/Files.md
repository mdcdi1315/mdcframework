# Reference Assemblies Used During Build
These are the required Reference Assemblies so as the Project can be sucessfully built.
There are also included the xxhash.dll and zstd.dll that are extensions of the ___MDCFR___
library and do only work when these files are located to the app's current working directory.
If you do not use the relevant functions , there is no need to include them in your project
and can be omitted.
